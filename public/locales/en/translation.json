The giveaways will be handed out based on the scoreboard and will be reset monthly. The design of every traits of each Metabunny had gone over many discussions before the finalising. We want to make sure every Metabunny will be unique with some being cute and others being scary. Each Metabunny will be classified by their Scary Meter on deciding which type it will be.  ",

The purpose of staking is to provide overtime value for our Metabunny holders in order to maintain a high floor price. We currently have no plans to list on DEXes as we want to make the token exclusive only to diamond hands(small letters) $CARATS will only be used for the Metabunny Ecosystem, our merchandise and has no real monetary value.",

The MetaDinosaur is scarier than any Metabunny and is only available to mint when ETH drops to a certain amount of threshold in a day. The Threshold will be varied and an announcement will be made available to everyone so that it won’t be missed but nobody will know exactly when it will happen. NFT holders can choose 2 Metabunnies and pay a certain amount of $CARATS to fuse into a MetaDinosaur. The maximum number of MetaDinosaur that can be minted will be 5,000 and each Metabunny can only be used for fusion once! More information on MetaDinosaur will be revealed later.",

We will integrate every Metabunny into the Bunnyverse so that Metabunny owners will be able to choose an avatar based on the appearance of their Metabunnies. There will be a “Scary to Earn” Mechanism where the more scary the bunny is, the more $CARATS it can earn. We will also be collaborating with other projects to build an exciting and diverse Bunnyverse for everyone.Daily Crypto raffle to all members (every day will be different for which crypto be drawn from the raffle (If OG members are chosen, the reward will be increased)"
